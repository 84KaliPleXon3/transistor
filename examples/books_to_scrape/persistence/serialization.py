~~~~~~~~~~~~
This module contains classes to serialize the data from a scrape object
after a scrape in a format that is able to be pickled and persisted in
a postgresql database with newt.db. and also exported to excel.

The attributes in the container object to be saved must match up to the
exporter class `write` methods.

    in this class object must all be pickleable. The main items we deal
    with which are not pickleable are beautifulsoup4 objects.

    Don't try to persist a beautifulsoup4 object in postgres with newt.db.
    To avoid issues, ensure that the result from a beautifulsoup4 object
    is cast to string. Wrapping it with str() will avoid issues.
